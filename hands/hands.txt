I'm getting up to leave when my new therapist asks me what my "official" gender is
(for insurance purposes, of course)
and I nod and tell him what he already knows.
I don't mention how my gender feels more like psychosis than performance,
prophetic imaginations of alternate planes,
that it makes it easier to breathe when I can tell myself
that this body, too, is transient and mutable.
I leave that for next session.

"You're really hard on yourself, huh?"
A question from across a desk above which hang 
gold lettered degrees and psychoanalytic training certificates.
This is the revelation from hours of digging 
through trauma, medical histories, childhood memories,
ruminations, suicidal ideations, accounts of self harm.
I should become kinder, it seems.

I am prescribed mindfulness like medication,
given my dialectical worksheets and meditation guides.
They do not speak of my rainbow body,
or of Kannon's infinite compassion,
of the diamond or of the womb.
If I am diligent in my secular studies, I wonder,
will I receive ten thousand hands?

That night I rewrite the poems written for my ex boyfriend,
combine them with my medication info sheets,
because aestheticizing my pain seems like an artsy thing to do
and I've run out of ways to tell him he's hurt me.

I write a new sutra professing my love.
I keep the wound agape.
