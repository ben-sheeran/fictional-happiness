Wendy's® has gone all-in on Sriracha with the debut of its Spicy Sriracha Chicken Sandwich. Available for a limited time, the entire sandwich – including the bun, the cheese and, of course, the sauce – is infused with Sriracha, satisfying even the most die-hard fans of the flavorful red sauce in a way that only Wendy's can. Starting with a toasted Sriracha-infused bun, a dollop of Sriracha aioli is added to amplify the chili-garlic taste. Next comes thick-cut, oven baked Applewood Smoked Bacon to bring out a savory note. Then even more Sriracha flavor is added with a custom Sriracha Jack cheese. The spiciness of the sandwich is layered with Wendy's always tender and flavorful Spicy Chicken filet. Featuring a fiery blend of eight spices and peppers, it gets its kick from a special mix of black pepper, chili pepper and mustard seed. To round out the full Sriracha-filled experience, Wendy's is also adding Bacon Sriracha Fries to the menu for a limited time. Made on a base of Wendy's natural-cut sea salt French fries and topped with a creamy Sriracha aioli, Applewood Smoked Bacon and a cheddar cheese sauce, the fries offer another way for Sriracha lovers to get their fix. Built using all the ingredients that made it so popular when it first hit the menu, the Taco Salad starts with a bed of fresh, hand-chopped iceberg and romaine lettuce and is topped with Wendy's signature chili, hand-diced tomatoes and shredded cheddar cheese. Beyond that, anything on the salad is your call! Wendy's provides the tortilla chips, sour cream and salsa – made with roasted tomatoes and ancho chili peppers – that allow you to concoct your own unique, flavorful Taco Salad creation. The new Grilled Chicken Sandwich features an all-white meat chicken breast that's marinated in herbs and seasonings. Grilled for caramelized flavor, it's topped with fresh ingredients like spring mix, fresh-cut tomatoes and a smoky honey mustard sauce. To finish it off, Wendy's created a new multi-grain bun made with a wholesome blend of red quinoa, bulgur wheat, millet, flax seed and oats for a nutty flavor with a touch of sweetness. The new Grilled Chicken Sandwich will be part of the everyday menu, but for a limited time only, a combo meal, including a small fry and small drink, is available for $5.00 at participating Wendy's. A cost that will keep you within budget. Some other guys use frozen beef and microwaved bacon, but Wendy's North American beef is from ranches close by so that it never has to be frozen. And only Wendy's tops that fresh, never frozen, North American beef1 with six strips of Applewood Smoked Bacon that's cooked in house every day—in fact, you can smell it cooking in our restaurants. To build this juicy collaboration, the Baconator starts with two ¼ lb. patties2 of 100% pure fresh beef. Then we add six strips of thick-cut Applewood Smoked Bacon on top of those patties for a savory, crispy and meaty bonus to your burger. With three slices of cheese and a bakery-style bun, you'll taste the difference and know you couldn't get a hamburger this good anywhere but Wendy's. As a companion to our one-of-a-kind Baconator, Wendy's is bringing back the Baconator Fries. A delicious blend of warm cheddar cheese sauce, freshly-cooked Applewood Smoked Bacon and shredded cheddar cheese drizzled over Wendy's natural-cut fries. Only Wendy's is able to serve the best of summer, like fresh strawberries and blackberries, on a bed of fresh-cut lettuce with feta cheese and crunchy red apple chips. Topped with freshly- grilled chicken breast and a light blackberry vinaigrette, this combination is a perfect balance of sweet and savory, creating a summer flavor experience prepared fresh daily in every Wendy's restaurant.

Getting strawberries from field to restaurant is a quickly choreographed dance. Six days a week, strawberries for McDonald's restaurants are picked by hand and only the freshest are chosen. They are gently washed, sorted, sliced and either quickly flash-frozen or puréed to ensure the best flavor and appearance. Suppliers then use strawberry purée blended with fruit juices to make the McCafé Smoothie base and strawberries are shipped to restaurants for Fruit N' Yogurt Parfaits to be prepared in the kitchens. Behind the counter in McDonald's kitchens, crew members blend smoothies using a strawberry purée, yogurt and ice and twice daily prepare Fruit 'N Yogurt parfaits for customers. Our WHOPPER® Sandwich is a ¼ lb* of savory flame-grilled beef topped with juicy tomatoes, fresh lettuce, creamy mayonnaise, ketchup, crunchy pickles, and sliced white onions on a soft sesame seed bun.

And, as if this day couldn’t get any better, they are only one dollar apiece! You read that right, $1.00! This triumphant return would not have been possible without the incredible and unrelenting passion of each and every one of the now 40,500+ members of the Beefy Crunch Movement and our friends over at Taco Bell with their dedication to every Taco Bell fan out there. As you know, the Beefy Crunch Movement started in 2011 (shortly after the Beefy Crunch Burrito left Taco Bell’s menu) with the sole mission of bringing it back. In those five years we have organized “Beefy Crunch Awareness Days”, created and proudly waved the “Beefy Crunch Movement” flag, but most importantly, we never stopped speaking. These past weeks have been a whirlwind with Taco Bell taking us under their wing, letting us lead the charge to share this news with the nation, beginning with our March 30 post on the Beefy Crunch Movement Facebook page announcing that the Beefy Crunch Burrito and Cheesy Double Beef Burrito would be returning. In the twenty-four hours following that post, over 15,000 people spread the news and our community grew by 2,000+ members. Since then we have been inundated by the outpouring of support and the never ending supply of Beefy Crunch stories from Taco Bell fans. From the crazy stories like the Beefy Crunch Burrito tattoos, cross-country road trips and first time skydiving just for a burrito, to the more down to earth moments with close friends and loved ones, we have shown Taco Bell just how important this burrito is to us. Since that post, we’ve organized local “Launch Day Eat-Ups” around the country, which we will document so the rest of the nation can celebrate with us. Fans in California, Michigan, and Ohio are gathering together today to reunite with the Beefy Crunch Burrito and its Flamin’ Hot Fritos goodness, flawlessly seasoned ground beef, fluffy rice, smooth sour cream and warm nacho cheese; and the Cheesy Double Beef Burrito, with its seasoned ground beef, nacho cheese, rice and red sauce perfection. It is a moment we have waited years for and one that will surely never be forgotten. Lastly, I’d like to dedicate my first Beefy Crunch Burrito bite to each of you - thank you for helping to make this dream a reality – and to Taco Bell for showing us that every fan matters. So get out there and buy a Beefy Crunch Burrito or two, not just for today's victory, but for tomorrow’s also, for this 2016 Limited Time Only promotion is a crucial step in the right direction of our journey. Continue to share your passion and love for the Beefy Crunch Burrito on social media, and let's show Taco Bell what amazing things are possible when we work together!
