I'm so scared of you
I'm bad again
I just saw that you blocked me on vent
I don't know what to do or how to make things better
I'm hurting a lot
I'm crying so much because I will never be good enough, I'll never be perfect, I'll always fuck up and
you hurt me so much and you don't even seem bothered
why did you tell me i was ok. why did you tell me i was doing good. why did you tell me i wasnt annoying you.
im trying to shut the fuck up and im sorry that i cant leave you alone cause you evidently really hate it but i am so fucking angry and hurt right now
like you couldnt have just left me on read you had to make fun of how insecure i am
like thats literally the number one thing im most insecure about right now and you know that and ive been trying so fucking hard to be better and you literally told me that i was doing better and you had to go after that.
what else can i do. what else can i do to make myself good enough for you. I tried to be so careful
If you really hate how much I talk to you fine, but fucking tell me. Tell me you need space. Don't pretend like you're ok and then get angry at me when I try to actually talk to my fucking boyfriend. Like i literally said so many times if i ever make you uncomfortable or you need space that you should tell me and every time i asked about if you were comfortable you rolled your eyes at me and told me you were fine.
im really tired of feeling like every time i talk to you im an inconvenience. If you dont want to talk to me dont. being left on read is better than feeling like ive become a burden.

please do not hurt me, love,
I am a fragile one, and you are the light in my eyes
please do not break my heart,
I think it's had enough pain to last the rest of my life
I’m so glad we’re talking again. I missed you a lot. The space was definitely a good thing and I’m glad you did it (even if it took me a while to figure that out). You were right. Even if it wasn’t a perfect execution on our part, it was still the right thing to do.
There were like 4 paragraphs here about like me being insecure but it’s common knowledge that I’m kinda fucked up. And the first couple days of us being apart were really bad (not really your fault, it was just sudden and unexpected and U Kno Me) but now I’m good. For some reason I think that if you don’t want to always be with me 100% of the time, it must be because you now hate me, want to never see me again, and want me to die (don’t worry I won’t go into that part). I’m trying to get better. I’m trying to stop myself from assuming the worst and panicking every time. It might take some time, though.
Thanks for forcing me to go to therapy. Really. I now get why you did it and I think it’s helping. I’m also doing some DBT with friends and am trying to figure out a med combo that works. But I need you to recognize that there are still going to be times where I find it hard to calm down or convince myself that you don’t hate me. Recently, it’s felt like you don’t want to put up with the part of me that is broken and insecure. You told me that you had thought about breaking up with me because of it. I’m going to try and get better, but I can’t just shut it off. The fear doesn’t stop. I want to get to a place where I’m not always terrified and afraid. And while most of that is going to be me working through my insecurities, I’m still going to need you to be understanding and caring.
Staying together isn’t going to be easy. But I think you’re worth it. I hope you think so of me too.
There’s not really a way to approach this part easily so I’m just going to go for it: you really hurt me that night. I’m not here to make you feel bad about that. I know that it’s not your fault, and for the most part I was able to contain my fear because of that. What hurt me more is that it didn’t seem like you were concerned about how I was doing. It didn’t seem like you understood that I had been hurt and needed you to say something.
I’m not saying that you cannot get mad, or that you cannot hurt me, or be upset, or lash out, or any of that. I know that’s a part of your mental illness and sometimes it’ll just happen. Sometimes you will be angry and there’s nothing that I’ll be able to do except sit. I know this. It’s okay. It’s okay for you to be angry at me. But I need to be able to talk to you about it afterwards. I need you to listen to me when I tell you that something you did to me was hurtful. That even if you couldn’t stop it and it isn’t your fault for doing it in the first place, you still have to help fix the damage. You have to make sure that the people you hurt are ok. You have to try and not hurt them in the same way.
I know you will not always be soft and gentle. I know there is anger in you. If you hurt me again, I’ll still stay. But I need to know that you will listen to me. 
One last thing (and I know I always say it, but bear with me): tell me when I fuck up. Tell me when I’ve gone too far and what you need from me. I know things will change and you won’t always feel the same about everything, but I’m really bad at guessing. I don’t want you to grow to resent me because of the accumulation of little hurts. Please don’t leave me in the dark. Please.
So please tell me: how was the past week for you? Why did this happen? How can I help?
We don’t have to do everything all at once. We can take it slowly. I want you to be okay. I don’t know how I can adequately communicate how much I love you and how badly I want to stay with you. But I do. I hope you let me show you in time. I hope you let me stay. I hope I can make you happy again.

and I will not tire of you

I have come so close to hurting myself the past few days.
I almost burned myself with a cigarette yesterday.
I am burdening people who want nothing to do with me.
